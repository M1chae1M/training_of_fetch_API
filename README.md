App fetch data from pokemon API and display pokemons. You can order results by pokemon type, or filter by name. The main purpose of this app is practice using the API. On right input (type number) i used debounce to prevent rerender app to many times.

Now I added next.js and dynamic routes. You can click picture with pokemon to get more info or use URL adres to your favourite pokemon.
